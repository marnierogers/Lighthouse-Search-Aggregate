# Lighthouse Search

Lighthouse Search is a Python program that allows users to search for pre-loved items from Autotrader, Gumtree and eBay. The program features an interactive GUI built with Tkinter, enabling users to select the latest, second or third item displayed in the search results. Additionally, users have the option to save their selections to a text file for future reference.
